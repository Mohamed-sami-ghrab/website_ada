## Project Overview

Online negativity is often assumed to be simple, impulsive, and poorly written.  
This project challenges that intuition.

Using more than **one million Reddit interactions (2014–2017)**, we explore how people **write**, how communities **develop linguistic norms**, and how those norms **shape interactions across Reddit’s network**.

Rather than focusing on *what* people talk about, we focus on *how* they express themselves:
- Is toxic language necessarily simple?
- Do communities specialize in a single writing style?
- Does language style influence how communities interact with others?
- Can linguistic complexity predict whether a message is positive or negative?

The answers are often surprising.

##  The Data Story

Our data story unfolds in three main parts:

### **Part 1 - Discovering Reddit’s Language Styles**
We analyze linguistic features (sentiment, grammar, structure) and use **unsupervised clustering** to uncover **five distinct language styles** on Reddit, ranging from casual meme language to structured, formal discourse and toxic satire.

We then ask whether subreddits behave as:
- **Linguistic specialists** (dominated by one style), or
- **Linguistic melting pots** (multiple styles coexisting)

This reveals how language norms emerge at the community level.

### **Part 2 - Language Style and Network Behavior**
Next, we connect language styles to Reddit’s **interaction network**.

We show that:
- Toxic/satirical communities are highly active linkers and export negativity.
- Formal communities link more constructively.
- Language style predicts **how communities act**, but not **how popular they are**.

Language does not just describe communities - it shapes their role in the network.

### **Part 3 - The Complexity Paradox**
Finally, we isolate **linguistic complexity** from emotional content.

Using multiple complexity metrics and machine learning models, we demonstrate that:
- Positive and negative messages are **equally complex**.
- Emotional features are far stronger predictors of sentiment than grammar or structure.
- Toxicity is about **what is expressed emotionally**, not **how sophisticated the language is**.

Anger on Reddit is often articulate.

## Notebooks & Additional Analyses

All analyses were conducted in **Jupyter notebooks**, which contain:
- Full preprocessing pipelines
- Feature engineering
- Statistical tests
- Clustering, PCA, and classification models
- Additional exploratory analyses and robustness checks

Some analyses go beyond what is presented in the public data story and are documented **only in the notebooks**.

**See notebooks for full technical details and complementary results.**

## ✨ Takeaway

Reddit is not just a collection of topic-based forums.  
It is a **linguistic ecosystem**, where communities develop distinct ways of speaking that shape how they interact with the rest of the platform.

And beneath all the structure and grammar, one rule dominates:

> **Emotion matters more than complexity.**
